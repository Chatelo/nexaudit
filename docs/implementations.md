# Rust CLI implementations and examples

The table below summarizes example implementations, patterns, and tooling referenced by the linked pages (Rust CLI Book, Rust website CLI guide, and Rust blog post).

| Source | Example / Pattern | Language / Crate | Purpose / Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| rust-cli book | Minimal clap-based CLI (Parser derive) | clap::Parser | Shows struct-based args parsing; tutorial starts a small tool that reads a file and prints N lines. Useful basic pattern for most CLIs. |
| rust-cli book | Packaging & docs | cargo, clap, manpage generation | Recommends packaging single binary, generating man pages, and distribution guidance. |
| rust-lang.org (CLI page) | clap example snippet | clap + structopt-style attributes | Short example showing how to define inputs and build a simple tool. |
| rust-lang.org (CLI page) | Configuration handling | config files (toml), cross-platform locations | Guidance to handle config files robustly. Links to deeper chapters in the CLI book. |
| rust-cli book | Machine-friendly IO | serde_json, structured output | Advice to offer both human and machine outputs (JSON/SARIF/etc). |
| rust-cli book | Logging & diagnostics | tracing, log | Recommends structured logging; shows patterns for human/machine logging. |
| rust-blog (rustwasm) | wasm-bindgen transfer note | wasm-bindgen, wasm-pack | Operational note: rustwasm org being sunset; wasm-bindgen moving â€” impacts where wasm-related tooling is maintained. Not a CLI implementation but important ecosystem note. |
| rust-blog (rustwasm) | Archival guidance | repository maintenance | Advises users to fork or pin dependencies if they rely on rustwasm repos. |

Notes:
- The table condenses examples and guidance across the three pages. For implementation-ready code, the rust-cli book contains a step-by-step tutorial and sample code for a beginner-friendly CLI that can be extended into production tools.
- The rustwasm blog post does not include CLI patterns but is important when considering WebAssembly bindings and distribution choices.
